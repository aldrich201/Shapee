Created this project as a way to practice what I've learned in my 3 months of watching tutorials

I've now reached a point where I'm comfortable with React lifecycles and the state / props are managed, given that.

 I realized that this project is not small enough to just handle state by passing it down to props. Which is why I'm transferring to redux. another reason is I'm now going to implement routing, which I will need to render only my homepage on one route.
